This program implements the dynamic programming approach for teh Longest palindromic Subsequence.
It takes an input file in the format:
. First line contains a number C>= 0 of test cases in the file, where 0<= C <= 10^6.
. Then comes C test cases, each of the following form: 
	- Line containing a string of length l containing lower-case alphabets (a-z), where 1<= l <= 10^3.
